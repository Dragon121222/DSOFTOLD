# DSOFTOLD
Old WIP 
So this is a collection of code from some of my old projects. 
I have abandonded the old way of manually generating all the gtk windows however for a new system of procedurally generating them. 
The ideas here are solid, but the implementation is still not perfect. 
I might add a list of dependancies later. 

The most interesting idea here is the machine learning constructor system. 
If a neural net is a universal approximator for every continuous operator, then what I have done is even more general somehow. 
Using this system, one can create a neural net or any other operator defined as the composition of other operators going from R^N to R^M.
This process is facilatated by a double function pointer which is filled through the use of the GUI. 
The next version of this software will be much better organized and hopefully, more complete.
